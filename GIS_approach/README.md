# `GIS approach to automate Data aquisition`

Here are all codes stored used to get GBIF coordinates that were then utilized to extract canopy height and bioclimatic mountain belt occurrences (see section 3.2 in my thesis for more information).

Bioclimatic Mountain Belts:
1. Extract GBIF and mountain belts from CHELSA: getGBIF.R
2. further processing in MountainBelt.R
Global tree canopy height
1. Extract from google earth engine: rgee_extract.R 
2. further processing in canopyHeight.R
