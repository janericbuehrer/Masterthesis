# `Supplementary Figures`

This repository holds all codes for the supplementary figures found in the appendix of my thesis. Note that figure A2 and A3 are part of the anc_reconstruction.R file.

Folder alternative approach (Appendix section A.1): The following will guide you through the process of my alternative approach to get events count from the JSON output of RevBayes:
1. Use the correct_json_output.py to make the output of RevBayes in line with JSON-structure.
2. Sample_from_JSON.R to randomly sample iterations from the huge output file generated by the MCMC simulation
3. The script alternative_approach_forConservatism.R is the executive file and the get_events_fromJSON.R holds all functions used to retrieve information from the json-output.

With this approach, it is possible to look at your shift rates and conservatism patterns within specific time windows. The time windows still need to be created and are not part of these codes. Events must then be normalized for each time window, e.g. by summing up the entire branch length of one window and divide it by the events occurring in that window (or similar).
