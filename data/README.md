## `data`
This directory holds the datasets used for the three ClaSSE models that were implemented in this phylogenetic study. The phylogeny of Gentiana is called Gentiana_cor.nex and is a corrected version (free of spelling mistakes of tip labels) of Favre et al. (2016) saved as a Nexus file. Gentiana_biome_distribution_raw_table contains all information gathered from the web-research including references on websites, databases, papers and books that were consulted for the classification of Gentiana species into the biome categories. Depending on the model implemented, you might want to choose the right CSV files, in order to work with the right classification types. They are derived from the complete Dataset Gentiana_biome_distribution_raw_table and the different versions demonstrate the individual biome states converted from bit format to natural numbers. Gent_biome_0.csv is the data used for the climate biome model, Gent_VegF_noNA_data_012.csv for the function biome model, and Gent_completeModel_nat.csv represents the combined states for the complex model.
