# `Master's Thesis Repository: Bayesian Modeling of Biome Conservatism and Shifts in Cold-Adapted Mountain Clade Gentiana`

This repository was created for my Master's Thesis. The thesis was part of the "Biome" project started by Niklaus Zimmermann 
at the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL).
The folder "ClaSSE Model" contains all the necessary codes to build a ClaSSE model on RevBayes.
The folder "data" stores all biome distribution data used to reconstruct the biome evolution of the plant genus Gentiana.
The folder "figures" holds the R codes for generating all figures presented in the thesis and appendix.
"Miscellaneous" codes were used in an attempt to acquire automatically distribution data through GBIF coordinates and assign them to the biome categories defined in this work.
