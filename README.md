Master's Thesis Repository
This repository was created for my Master's Thesis. The thesis was part of the "Biome" project started by Niklaus Zimmermann 
at the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL).
The folder "ClaSSE Model" contains all necessary codes to build a ClaSSE model on RevBayes.
The folder "Figures" hold the R codes for generating all figures presented in the thesis and appendix.
"Miscellaneous" codes used in an attempt of acquiring automatically distribution data through GBIF coordinates and assign them to the biome categories defined in this work.
