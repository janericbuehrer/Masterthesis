## `analysis`

Data_structure: This folder contains code that I have used for retrieving data (flora alpina), and checking the POWO library for any synonyms and spelling mistakes.

MCMC chains were also checkt for convergence using the bonsai package in R.

Prior to the Model analysis i have tested for phylogenetic signal (see pre_MCMC_analysis).
