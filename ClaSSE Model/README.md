# `ClaSSE Model`

This directory houses all scripts associated with the phylogenetic model built on RevBayes, including code used in processing, analysis, exploration, and 
visualization.

This directory is broken into several subdirectories: 
- analysis contains R-codes to analyse data distribution, check for convergence in MCMC runs, and post-processing the results from a MCMC simulation in a Bayesian framework. 
- figures hold all R-scripts to create the figures demonstrated in the Master's thesis.
- RevBayes_scripts is composed of all scripts that are used to build a model on RevBayes.
